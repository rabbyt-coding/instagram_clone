Flutter Instagram Clone UI with Mock Data Service

This Flutter project is an Instagram clone user interface (UI) implementation. It showcases a visually appealing and user-friendly interface that closely resembles the popular social media app, Instagram.

In addition to the UI, this project also includes a service with an async method that simulates communication with an external REST API. However, instead of making actual API calls, the service fetches data from a mock data file included within the project.

This project serves as a valuable resource for Flutter developers interested in building Instagram-like applications or those who want to learn about implementing UI designs in Flutter. It provides an opportunity to explore complex UI elements, such as feeds, stories, profiles, and more, while also demonstrating best practices for managing asynchronous operations with services.

Enjoy the process of designing and developing, and have fun creating amazing Flutter applications!
